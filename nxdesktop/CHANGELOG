ChangeLog:

nxdesktop-1.3.2-9

- Reversed modifications imported from 1.3.1 branch
  in order to try to improve stability.

nxdesktop-1.3.2-8

- Added support for RDP compressed and non-compressed 
  image cache.

- Image cache is now enabled by default.

- Found wrong RDP initialization parameter left from previous 
  attempts of use the compressed image cache.
  Return it back to the original value seens to correct 
  the hanging problem reported.

NOTE: Despite the change above seens to stop the hanging 
      problem, more testing is required to be sure. 
      In any case, the original way the RDP inputs are 
      handled can (and will) be vastly improve.

nxdesktop-1.3.2-7

- Added extra parameter -imgcache to enable the
  experimental image cache .
  
- Image cache is disabled by default now.

- Removed modified RDP compressiom parameter left 
  from experiences.

nxdesktop-1.3.2-6

- Changed log and initial messages.

- Cleaned up compiling warnings.

- Corrected typo in CHANGELOG.

nxdesktop-1.3.2-5

- Enabled image caching.

NOTE: The image caching is highly experimental and, right now, 
      is causing a worst performance than without it.

- Imported 1.4.0-19 from the 1.4.0 development branch.
