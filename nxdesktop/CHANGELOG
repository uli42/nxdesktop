ChangeLog:

nxdesktop-1.4.0-27

- Solved bug that was causing messed bitmaps to be cached.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-26

- Solved bug on decompressing 1 bpp bitmaps bigger than 128 
  pixels.
  
- Fixed typo on connection error message.

- Fixed wrong typecast on secure.c.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-25

- Fixed memory leak on ui_create_gliph.

- Fixed typecast bug in channels.c.

- Bitmap handling completely re-written with special 
  decompressing routines for 1, 4 and 8 BPP.

- Added MPPC (Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression) support.

- Added printer status e redirection support.

- Added disk status and better redirection support.

- Changed RDP layer processing to add support to new PDU 
  messages.

- Changed ISO layer to prevent freeze caused by some windows 2003
  configurations.
  
- Changed secure layer to reflect changes on ISO layer.

- Better font handling.

- Advertizing capabilitites changed to reflect the new resources.

- RDP redirection now has lock control.

- Better color translation added.

- Added window resize support.

NOTE: The window resize is from server to client only. In theory
      it can be done from the client but will require to disconnect 
      and reconect with the new window size.
      It's expected RDP 6 to have dynamic resizing and seamless 
      mode implemented.
      The MPPC compression support is highly experimental and
      disabled for now by default.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-24

- Fixed possible problem if the Rects buffer overflows.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-23

- Fixed problem that can be caused if nxdesktop is called 
  by nxserver disabling RDP5.
  
NOTE: This is not a possibility today as we don't have such
      option now on the interface but it's a future bug squashed
      before it's born.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-22

- First implementation of reduced XFillRects now works.

- Fixed two typos in CHANGELOG

- Added define NXDESKTOP_USES_RECT_BUF to help evaluate the
  performance. If undefined, the old code is used.

NOTE: This first implementation was done in the solid XFillRect 
      which is, by far, the most used. Now that the necessary 
      flushing points are stablished, the others are easy to 
      implement if necessary, due it's very low incidence.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-21

- Redirection is now enabled to allow experimentation with it.

- Initial code to minimize the use of XFillRects in place.

NOTE: This modification is not working fully but if no windows 
      is dragged one can use it to test the statistics.

nxdesktop-1.4.0-20

- Merged code from 1.3.2 branch.

- Solved bug that prevented nxdesktop to run if called directly from 
  the command line.

NOTE: This bug was caused by a unforseen combination of having
      the compressed rdp bitmaps activated without the NX transport.
